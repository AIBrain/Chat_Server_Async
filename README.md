# Chat_Server_Async
An Asynchronous Chat Server program that handles simple ASCII messages over LAN using TCP

This is a really basic server program that works with Chat_Client_Winforms for sending ASCII messages between all users of the client program.

More info will come in the future as the product is developed further.
